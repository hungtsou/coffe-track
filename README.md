# Drug Supply Chain Integrity

The current mono-repo is a simple project to showcase the ease and power of [Convector](https://worldsibu.io/convector) by creating a basic Drug Supply Chain fullstack application example.

Some of the challenges on the field are:

* Public health risks due to counterfeit or diluted drugs.
* Complex value chains.
* Speed.
* Global distribution and manufacturing.

A somewhat typical value chain in this industry looks like:

A few high level reasons on why Blockchain may help here, are the following (for a real application, further analysis is required):

* Who keeps the data?
* How to certify each participant's information.
* How to assure integrity and durability of the data.
* How to make it cost-effective.
* Public health data should be public?

The end result:

* You get a drug at the hospital or any drug store and are able to trace it back through the whole value chain. Sort of like tokenizing the drugs through a value chain.

## Run the project

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```

Build the chaincode (running `npm i` already did this for you):
```bash
lerna run build --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-cc-drug
lerna run build --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-cc-participant
```

Wake up the environment and install the components.

```bash
# Start the development blockchain and install chaincodes
npm run restart
```

Run the project

```bash
# Start the server
lerna run start:dev --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the ui project
lerna run start --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-ui --stream
```

Go to `localhost:4200` and use the application!

Since the "user" running the server is a blockchain identity coming from a certificate, to make it easy to switch between users you can use the scripts:

## Multiple users (transfer and other functions)

To have multiple users registered in the network you need to start the server per each user that will be
available with these example scripts ðŸ‘‡

```
# Start the server as the first user of the org 1
lerna run start:org1:user1 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the server as the second user of the org 1
lerna run start:org1:user2 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the server as the third user of the org 1
lerna run start:org1:user3 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the server as the first user of the org 2
lerna run start:org2:user1 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the server as the second user of the org 2
lerna run start:org2:user2 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
# Start the server as the third user of the org 2
lerna run start:org2:user3 --scope @worldsibu/convector-example-dsc-server --stream
```
